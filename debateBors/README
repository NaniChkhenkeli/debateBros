# DebateBros - AI Debate Game

DebateBros is an interactive debate game where players can engage in structured debates with Pro and Con positions. The game uses AI to generate debate topics and judge the arguments.

## Features

- Interactive debate format with Pro and Con sides
- AI-generated debate topics and subtopics
- Scoring system based on logic, evidence, persuasiveness, and relevance
- Animated characters and visual effects
- End-of-game summary with winner announcement



## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame
- Requests
- Ollama (for AI functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/debatebros.git
   cd debatebros
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame requests
   ```

3. Install Ollama (for AI judging):
   - Visit https://ollama.ai/ to download and install Ollama
   - Pull the LLaMA3 model:
     ```
     ollama pull llama3
     ```

## Running the Game

1. Make sure Ollama is running:
   ```
   ollama serve
   ```

2. Start the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. Start Screen:
   - Enter a debate topic
   - Set the number of rounds (1-8)
   - Click "START"

2. During the Debate:
   - The PRO side argues first
   - Type your argument (at least 20 characters)
   - Press Enter to submit
   - The CON side argues next
   - After both sides have argued, the AI will judge and assign scores

3. Scoring:
   - Arguments are scored on:
     - Logical coherence
     - Evidence quality
     - Persuasiveness
     - Relevance to the topic

4. Winning:
   - The side with the highest total score at the end of all rounds wins

## Development

### Adding New Assets

To add new character animations or backgrounds:

1. Place new images in the corresponding folders:
   - `images/character1/` for PRO character
   - `images/character2/` for CON character
   - `images/attack/` for special animations

2. Images should be named numerically starting from 1 (e.g., 1.png, 2.png, etc.)

### Modifying AI Behavior

To change how the AI judges arguments, edit the prompts in `ai/debate_ai.py`.

### Troubleshooting

- **Missing Images**: The game will create placeholder images if originals are not found
- **AI Connection Errors**: Make sure Ollama is running with `ollama serve`
- **Sound Issues**: The game will run with silent placeholders if sound files are missing
