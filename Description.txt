DebateBros: AI-Powered Debate Judge
Team Information

Group Name: Sudoku
Participants: Saba Tchumburidze, Saba Danelia, Nani Chkhenkeli

Problem Statement
Debates are valuable for developing critical thinking, but traditional debate formats face significant challenges: human judges often introduce unintentional bias,
professional judging is inaccessible for casual practice, and participants rarely receive immediate, structured feedback on their arguments.
Solution Overview
DebateBros is an interactive application that provides an AI-powered debate judge to evaluate arguments fairly and impartially. Two players engage in structured debates,
with one presenting a Pro argument and the other presenting a Con argument on AI-generated topics. The LLM assesses argument quality based on logical coherence, evidence quality, persuasiveness,
and relevance.


Key Features

AI Topic Generation: System creates relevant debate questions based on user-selected topics
Structured Debate Format: Clear turn-taking between Pro and Con positions
Comprehensive Evaluation: AI scoring across multiple dimensions of argument quality
Immediate Feedback: Detailed assessment and improvement suggestions for each argument
Engaging Interface: Game-like environment that makes debate practice more accessible

Technical Implementation

Core Language: Python for application logic and LLM integration
AI Component: Ollama running Llama3 for topic generation and argument evaluation
User Interface: Pygame for creating an interactive graphical experience

How It Works

Topic Selection: Players choose a debate theme and number of rounds
Question Generation: AI creates specific debate questions on the selected theme per round
Argument Submission: Players take turns submitting Pro and Con arguments
AI Evaluation: The system analyzes arguments across multiple criteria
Results & Feedback: Scores are displayed and a winner is determined based on cumulative performance

Educational Value
DebateBros aligns with the American Debate League's emphasis on debate as a tool for developing:

Critical thinking and analytical skills through structured argument construction
Effective communication abilities through clear articulation of complex ideas
Confidence in presenting and defending positions on challenging topics

Future Development Potential
As a 24-hour hackathon project, DebateBros demonstrates significant potential for expansion:

Voice input capabilities for more natural debating
Advanced feedback with personalized improvement strategies
Expanded topic libraries with varying difficulty levels
Integration with educational platforms for classroom use

This one-day prototype showcases how AI can make debate practice more accessible, providing immediate, structured feedback without requiring a human judge.
